Web Developer Test

# Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run server
```

Server will be listening at http://localhost:8080/

# TODO

For this test

- Fix the `GlossaryTable` component to display french words
- Add actions and reducers to modify the store
  - Sort words by english
  - Remove duplicates (a duplicate occurs when both english and french words of two elements are equal)
- Add bootstrap styled buttons to trigger the custom actions you created earlier

After completing the tasks please submit the completed project back in a `.zip` without version controlled or temporary files.

This test assumes some familiarity with web developer tools.  It is also open ended in some areas - we want to see how you might approach each of the given tasks.
